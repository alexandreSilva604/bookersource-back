# bookersource-back

WORK-IN-PROGRESS

Backend companion to [bookersource-front]("https://github.com/alexandreSilva604/bookersource-front"), required to use all of its features.

# Getting Started

In order to use it, you must download [Docker]("https://www.docker.com/"). After installing it, open it and in your preferred Java IDE, you must open the terminal and type the following command:

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

Now you are able to fully use the BookerSource application, with the ability to register an account and log in with it, and manage hotel rooms if you are an administrator (in the future, you'll be able to register a reservation). You can also access and tinker with the database using [MySQL Workbench]("https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/").
